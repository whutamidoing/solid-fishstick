Welcome to the Convergence mod. This mod grants you a whole new Dark Souls experience with newly added spells. Existing spells that used to be 'bad' were improved. Encounter various new hostile NPCs named after SoulsBorne runners like speedrunner Distortion and various no hit runners. Each one of them will use a specific build. We added about 20 starting classes e.g. Cryomancer (ice spells), Alchemist, Blood Priest and Geomancer (physical pyromancies).
We added a few new weapons and armor sets as well. Armor sets have all unique passive effects also.

## About this mod

The Convergence mod is an exhaustive overhaul of Elden Ring with dozens of new weapons, hundreds of new spells, extensively revamped areas and maps, new enemies, bosses and much more.

In Convergence we allow all players to uncover their expertise in Alchemy.
We made Alchemy way more viable by adding over 40 new items like urns, bombs, potions, and elixirs.
Since Alchemists are masters in crafting their materials on the fly, we made sure that the player can craft any material at any bonfire through the "Alchemy Crafting" option.

DLC: Shadow of the Erdtree is required to play Elden Ring The Convergence
