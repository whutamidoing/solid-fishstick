FromSoftware is now established as one of the greatest AAA studios of our time, producing classic after classic under the inscrutable eye of director (and now company president) Hidetaka Miyazaki. Most of these games have found their way to PC. But the PlayStation 4 exclusive Bloodborne, which many including myself consider FromSoftware's masterpiece, remains locked to that platform.

## Retired PlayStation exec reckons Bloodborne PC hasn't happened because Miyazaki 'cannot do it himself, but he doesn’t want anyone else to touch it'

In an interview with Kinda Funny Games (timestamp, and first spotted by Kotaku), Yoshida is asked about Bloodborne's future. "Bloodborne has always been the most asked thing, and people wonder why we haven’t really done anything like an update or remaster which should be easy," says Yoshida. "Sony’s known for doing so many remasters, right? And people get frustrated."

Erm.. yeah? So where's the Bloodborne remaster or a sequel to one of the best-received first-party games Sony's ever had?

"I have only my personal theory to that situation," says Yoshida. "I left first-party [Sony], so I don’t know what’s going on, but my theory is because I remember Miyazaki really, really loved Bloodborne, you know what he created and so I think he is interested, but he’s so successful and he’s so busy so he cannot do it himself, but he doesn’t want anyone else to touch it. So that’s my theory, and the PlayStation team respects his wish."

Yoshida's at pains to emphasise that this is "my guess, my theory" and "I'm not revealing any secrets to be clear." Then, like the fleeting glimpses of hope scattered through Yharnam, the topic is gone.

## A Step by Step Full Guide to play Bloodborne on PC

How to play Bloodborne on PC

- Install the emulator - https://github.com/diegolix29/shadPS4

You want the one that says qt in the link of your OS. eg win64-qt

Go into properties of shadPS4.exe and check run as administrator and check disable full screen optimisation

Make a games folder in the shadPS4 folder, Bloodborne folder inside the games folder, mods folder inside Bloodborne folder

Open shadPS4.exe and set both paths to the games folder you just made

Go into settings and change updates to 'Release' as it is more stable. Feel free to do 'Nightly' if you want. (In the latest version of the emulator V.0.6.1 the update channel has changed. Set to "Full-Souls" if "Release" isn't there)

Change log type to 'sync'

Switch to input tab and set cursor to 'always hidden'

Switch to graphics tab and select your GPU, then set Vblank Divider to 4

Click apply then save

- Install the game. I cannot directly link anything in this post or in DM's. You'll have to search around. (AD Blocker Advised. I also ran a full scan on my PC, no viruses, nothing dodgy happening, my PC is working fine)

You want the one that says 'Bloodborne 1.09 DLC and Mods'. It will take roughly 1hr 45 mins because of throttled download (Update 18/02/2025 - No longer available but if you can get the base game (GOTY) and a patch you are good)

Once installed, click file in the shadPS4 emulator and then install packages (.PKG)

Select the larger file first which says 'Bloodborne 1.09'. It will take a while to extract

Once completed, install the other PKG that says ‘Version Fix 1.09'

Here is an example of the files - https://imgur.com/a/bloodborne-pc-JfmwxGF

- Install these mods: Vertex Explosion Fix - https://www.nexusmods.com/bloodborne/mods/109?tab=files

RAM Spike No Cloth Physics - https://www.nexusmods.com/bloodborne/mods/114

Intel/AMD Crash Fix - https://www.nexusmods.com/bloodborne/mods/41?tab=files

Jump on L3 (Optional) - https://www.nexusmods.com/bloodborne/mods/156

Note - These mods are only here if you need them! You may not need any at all. Figure it out by trial and error

Put all of these mods in the mod folder you created earlier

Go into your games folder and there should be a folder called CUSA00900

(Optional step) Copy and paste the dvdroot_ps4 folder for a backup

Open each of your mods folders and copy the dvdroot_ps4 folder into the CUSA00900 folder

For the RAM Spike mod you need to open the main dvdroot_ps4 folder then paste the mtd folder in

Just in case anybody asks where they go here is an image guide for mods - https://imgur.com/a/image-guide-bloodborne-pc-R35IIzg

- Go back to the emulator and right click on Bloodborne then click cheats/patches

Change to patches tab, change repository to shadPS4 then click download patches

Check each of these: Skip Intro

Disable Chromatic Aberration

Disable Motion Blur

Disable HTTP Requests

60 FPS (With Deltatime)

Disable vsync

Resolution Patch 720p

(I recommend 720p but you can go higher if you want or lower if needed)

1440p or higher are quite choppy and have more issues but you can try to run it if you want

Click save once you have checked all of these.

You should now be able to play Bloodborne! Click the play button or double click on Bloodborne

It won’t be perfect, you might get the odd crash here and there but it runs!

If it says eboot.bin file not found, try restarting the emulator. If it crashes on startup you may need to downgrade the shadPS4 version (fresh install). I use an AMD setup and the latest version of shadPS4 does not work. Currently for me it works on V.0.4.1

V.0.4.1 was removed however I reuploaded it should anyone want/need it - https://github.com/CRIXSHWA/diegolix29s-shadPS4-V.0.4.1/releases (Windows Only)
