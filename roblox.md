You can get the FUGA Chant in Jujutsu Infinite by completing the Frost Sorcerer's quest. To get the chant and finish the quest, you must obtain these items:

Do note that you can use FUGA Flame Chant without a domain. Having said that, the heian awakening does the most damage when used within a domain, so make sure to obtain Domain Expansion first. Here's a step-by-step guide to unlocking the FUGA Chant in Jujutsu Infinite.
