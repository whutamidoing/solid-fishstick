Mondstadt's alchemy industry is booming, driven by a soaring demand for all kinds of potions to overcome the trials and tribulations of daily life.
But not every problem in life has such a simple, ready-made solution.
In the subjective world of art and fashion, Chiori continues to make her mark by doing things in her own, unorthodox, inimitable way.

## New Characters

An independent designer hailing from Inazuma who strives to make her brand internationally recognized across all of Teyvat, Chiori is the industrious yet headstrong owner of Chioriya Boutique, a fashion label in Fontaine which has also served as an "intelligence boutique" for law enforcement. Steadfast in attaining what she wants, she refuses to change her ways and personality to conform with societal norms.
