Silksong was originally conceived as downloadable content for Hollow Knight, but the scope of the project grew enough that Team Cherry announced it as a separate sequel in February 2019.

## Hollow Knight: Silksong

Hollow Knight: Silksong is a Metroidvania video game in development by Australian independent developer Team Cherry. The sequel to Hollow Knight, it is being developed for Linux, macOS, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S.

Hollow Knight: Silksong gameplay is set to be similar to its predecessor Hollow Knight, featuring 2D platforming and combat. Some changes are made from the original, such as the player character moving with a more acrobatic flair or applying instant self-healing. Side-quests will be part of the game, and include a journal to keep track of them. This includes a quest system divided into four categories titled Gather, Wayfarer, Hunt, and Grand Hunt, which are provided by the non-player characters in the game or by quest boards.

Team Cherry stated Silksong to be very large, featuring at least 165 new enemies and over 100 different checkpoints ("benches") throughout the game world, compared to 41 in Hollow Knight.

## Premise

Hornet is captured and taken to the unknown kingdom of Pharloom, which is said to be "haunted by Silk and Song", and must climb to the top to reach a shining citadel.

## Development

Hollow Knight: Silksong was announced on 14 February 2019 in a trailer and with a developer diary video sharing more information. Since the announcement, per GameSpot, "updates have been sporadic and infrequent".

Eventually, due to the increased scope of the project, Team Cherry decided to expand the downloadable content to a full sequel.

An article in PC Gamer from February 2022 showcased Team Cherry co-director William Pellen stating that the game was still in development despite the lack of updates since December 2019 and said that more details would be revealed as the game got closer to its release.

## Reception

In May 2022, Hollow Knight: Silksong won a "Most Anticipated Game" award from Unity. In response, Team Cherry thanked the community for their support and said "It can't be too much longer, surely!" Silksong won the same award again in 2024, this time without any official acknowledgment.
