It's finally happened! The Creation Kit for Starfield dropped as part of Bethesda's announcements during the Xbox Showcase last night, along with the first round of "Creations" available for purchase and a preview of the upcoming Shattered Space DLC. In this post, I'll give a little primer on the Creation Kit and provide a few essential tips based on the latest changes to the game.

## What is the Creation Kit?

If you're new to Bethesda modding, the Creation Kit is the official software development kit (SDK) which allows community authors to create and share mods. There are equivalent Creation Kits for Skyrim, Skyrim Special Edition and Fallout 4. It is the evolution of the Construction Set used in Oblivion and Morrowind or the Garden of Eden Creation Kit (G.E.C.K.) used in Fallout 3 and New Vegas.

The tool is a stripped-down version of the editor that Bethesda's developers use to create the game and DLCs. It allows modders to create and edit almost all existing game objects including quests, items, locations and more. It's an incredibly powerful tool!

Right now, there is no public documentation for Starfield, but if you want to understand some basic concepts of how the editor works, you can check out the official Skyrim and Fallout 4 wiki here.

## What's new in Starfield's CK?

You can expect a more comprehensive list of new features on the CK wiki but here are a few highlights:

- **Unique vs Instanced Content** - Content is now organised into unique and instanced content depending on how it is intended to be used. Unique content is for static locations (e.g. a specific interior on a single planet), whereas instanced content is generated at runtime and can be re-used around the galaxy (e.g. the Starborn Temples are re-used on various planets).
- **Planet Content Manager (PCM)** - A new system similar to (but not replacing) Story Manager in previous games. This controls the procedural content in planets and space cells.
- **Galaxy View** - A new data management tool for managing different stellar bodies, including stars, planets, moons, asteroid belts, star stations, and generic orbitals.
- **Worldspace overlays** - Instead of creating the terrain for an entire planet, you will create mini-worldspaces which are then stitched into the procedural terrain on the surface of one or more planets.
- **Particle Editor** - Create particle-based effects using emitters in the Creation Engine.
- **Easier Navmesh** - Creating navmesh is now as easy as dropping down a marker in your interior (manual navmeshing is still possible).
- **Render Window Layers** - Managing large interiors or exteriors is easier than ever with assignable layers to show/hide different content.
- **PackIns (PI)** - These replace Static Collections and allow a group of objects to act as a single object in the Render Window.
- **And many great improvements to usability and stability compared to Fallout 4 and Skyrim's CKs!**

As a bonus, Bethesda has also included integrations for commonly used tools including VSCode for Papyrus scripting and 3DSMax for 3D assets.
