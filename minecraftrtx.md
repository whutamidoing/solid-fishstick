## Choose Your Style

- Complementary Shaders comes with two distinct visual style options. The only difference between these two styles

- is the default settings. The Unbound style is designed for people looking for a more realistic experience,
  while the Reimagined style is made to reimagine Minecraft while preserving its unique visual elements.
  Please note that you can still customize everything after your download either style. You can switch to blocky clouds

- on the Unbound style, or use realistic water on the Reimagined style. All settings are located in Shader Options.
