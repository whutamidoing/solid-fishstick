Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty (Polish: Cyberpunk 2077: Widmo Wolno≈õci) is a 2023 expansion pack for the 2020 video game Cyberpunk 2077 developed by CD Projekt RED. The expansion introduces a new district to the game's open world, as well as a new quest line.

## Gameplay

Cyberpunk 2077 is an action role-playing video game played from a first-person perspective. The story of the Phantom Liberty expansion is set in a new district named "Dogtown", which has its own unique characters, quests and gigs. Phantom Liberty introduces a new Relic skill tree with nine abilities. To unlock new Relic skills, players must progress the story of Phantom Liberty, or access restricted data terminals found in Dogtown. The DLC also raises the level cap to 60, and adds new weapons and vehicles into the game. New quickhacks are also added to the game, allowing players to perform actions such as air dashing, seeing through walls, or changing V's appearance on the fly. Vehicular combat is also added, allowing players to drive cars armed with missile launchers and machine guns. Depending on player's decision, a new ending for the base game will be unlocked.
The tool is a stripped-down version of the editor that Bethesda's developers use to create the game and DLCs. It allows modders to create and edit almost all existing game objects including quests, items, locations and more. It's an incredibly powerful tool!

## Synopsis

- **Setting and characters** - Cyberpunk 2077 takes place in Night City, an American megacity in the Free State of North California, controlled by corporations and unassailed by the laws of both country and state. Players take on the role of Vincent / Valerie, also known as "V" (Gavin Drea / Cherami Leigh), a mercenary who was killed, then revived by an experimental Arasaka biochip called "the Relic", and ends up with a digitized engram of legendary rock star Johnny Silverhand (Keanu Reeves) existing within their mind. Together, V and Johnny search for a way to prevent the Relic from killing the former and replacing their mind with Johnny's.

- **Plot** - Following a venture into the Pacifica district of Night City, the mercenary V is contacted by Song "Songbird" So Mi, the aide of NUSA President Rosalind Myers. She explains that their aircraft has been hacked and is about to crash in the lawless district of Dogtown, ruled by warlord Kurt Hansen. Songbird asks V to help rescue Myers in return for her assistance in preventing the Relic from destroying V's brain. V saves Myers and escorts her to a safehouse, but they lose contact with Songbird on the way.

- **Development** - Development of Phantom Liberty cost more than $60 million. In September 2022, CD Projekt Red confirmed that Phantom Liberty would be released for PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PlayStation 5 in 2023. In November 2022, it was confirmed that Phantom Liberty would be a paid expansion pack, akin to Witcher 3 expansions Blood and Wine and Hearts of Stone. A trailer for Phantom Liberty was released during The Game Awards 2022 which revealed Idris Elba had joined the project. A release date of 26 September 2023 for the Phantom Liberty expansion was revealed during the 2023 Xbox showcase as part of the Summer Game Fest.
